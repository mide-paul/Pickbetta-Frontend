                PickBetta's privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information that may
                be collected by PickBetta anytime you interact with PickBetta, such as when you visit our
                website, purchase PickBetta products and services, or contact our sales or support associates.
                Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices,
                including what type of information is gathered, how it is used and for what purposes, to whom

                <p className="relative ml-16 mt-4 text-left text-base text-dark max-w-13">
                We collect personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer
                service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and
                focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information
                helps us keep you informed about the latest product announcements, updates, special offers,
                and events that you might be interested in.

                2. What Information Do We Collect?
                </h3>
                <p className="relative ml-16 mt-4 text-left text-base text-dark max-w-13">
                There are several situations in which your personal information can help us provide better
                service. For example, we may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a
                service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading a product, registering your products,
                or purchasing a product. At such times, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation,
                such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit
                card information; and information about the PickBetta products you own, such as invoice numbers and
                dates of purchase. We also collect information regarding customer activities on our website and on
                related websites, which helps us determine how best to provide useful information to customers and
                understand which parts of our websites and services are of most interest to them.
                The PickBetta website allows you to create a "User ID" based on your personal information.
                This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services. Here’s
                how it works: You create a personal profile—providing your name, phone number, email address,
                and in some cases your mailing address or credit card number—and choose a password for security.
                The system saves your information and assigns you a personal User ID. The next time you order from
                the PickBetta Store or purchase any of our products, all you need to do is enter your User ID and
                Password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the
                information associated with your User ID, it will be available for all your transactions with PickBetta
                globally. If you use a bulletin board or chat room on a PickBetta website, you should be aware that any
                information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one
                of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages.
                PickBetta is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
                forums.

                PickBetta takes your privacy very seriously. Be assured that PickBetta does not sell or rent
                your contact information to other marketers. To help us provide superior service, your 
                personal information may be shared with legal entities within the PickBetta group globally, 
                who will safeguard it in accordance with PickBetta's privacy policy. There are also times when
                it may be advantageous for PickBetta to make certain personal information about you available
                to companies that PickBetta has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for
                PickBetta to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us
                process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage
                and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and
                services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also
                obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with PickBetta's policies.
                Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase
                products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to
                improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the
                PickBetta website.
                At times, we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We
                may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law
                enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

                PickBetta takes precautions—including administrative, technical, and physical measures—to
                safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized
                access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. The PickBetta Online Store and website use
                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required.
                To make purchases from PickBetta, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Netscape
                Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your
                personal and credit card information while it's transmitted over the Internet. You can help us
                by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change
                your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a
                secure web browser like Safari.

                As is standard practice on most websites, PickBetta's website may use "cookies" and other
                technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where
                our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other
                technologies to ensure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and
                services. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to
                make it even more rewarding, as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer
                communications. We use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience
                each time you interact with us.
                As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
                files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
                service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
                clickstream data.
                We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,
                administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather demographic
                information about our user base as a whole. PickBetta will not use the information collected
                to market directly to any person.
                In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the
                PickBetta website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server
                before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us
                determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer
                communications. If you prefer not to be tracked, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links
                in the email.
                In addition, we use pixel tags—tiny graphic images—to tell us what parts of our website
                customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our
                site.

                and in all aspects of electronic commerce. We do not knowingly solicit personal information
